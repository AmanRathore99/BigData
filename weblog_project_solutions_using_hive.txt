To Create Table:-  create table web (client_ip string, full_request_date string, day int, month string, month_num int, year int, hour int, minute int, second int, method string, uri string, http_status_code string, bytes_returned int, referrer string, user_agent string, browser string) row format delimited fields terminated by '\t';

To load the Table:-
load data local inpath '/home/hduser/Desktop/mmc_weblog1' into table web;




Analysis 1)

Analysis 2)

create table ana2 as select http_status_code, COUNT(client_ip) as cnt from web group by http_status_code order by cnt desc;

select * from ana2 limit 1; 



Analysis 3)

create table ana3 as select browser, COUNT(client_ip) as cnt from web group by browser order by cnt desc;
